   The {@code Reader} interface is implemented by format specific
   decoders. The basic operation of a decoder is to decode sequences
   of bytes encoded in one of the Blink formats, into objects.

   <p>This interface provides {@code read} methods that collect
   decoded objects into instances of {@link Block}. The {@code read}
   methods that do not take a {@code Block} argument relies on the
   implementation for further processing. Typically this means that
   the read objects get dispatched to a set of type specific
   observers.</p>
